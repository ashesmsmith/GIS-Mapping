# Overview

The GIS-Mapping program uses multiple Google Maps APIs to create a Travel Itinerary that includes current weather information in the user entered locations.

The user enters their desired locations and the program calculates the route, total distance, total duration, and the fetches the current weather for each location.

The program was written for the purpose of having a visual representation of a travel route and the weather along the way.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- Add a layover showing the weather across the route instead of only the destinations
- Add the ability to view a weather forecast for 3,5, and 7 days later
- Add more data such as humidity, wind speed, feels like temperature, and more
- Add the ability to remove locations from the list
